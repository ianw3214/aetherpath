# LUDUM DARE 46

This game is made as a compo entry for ludum dare 46 - the theme is **keeping it alive**

## SUMMARY

In this game, you will have to manage humanity to ensure its survival. While earth is falling into ruins, you command spaceships to gather resources no longer available to earth in hopes that humanity can survive.

## IDEAS

- How will the game end?
  - Research based - spend certain amount of resources to 'unlock' humanities survival
  - Exploration based - find a habitable planet for humanity
  - Why not both? alternate endings :D
