# LUDUM DARE 46

This game is made as a compo entry for ludum dare 46 - the theme is **keeping it alive**

## SUMMARY

In this game, you will have to manage humanity to ensure its survival. While earth is falling into ruins, you command spaceships to gather resources no longer available to earth in hopes that humanity can survive.

## IDEAS

- How will the game end?
  - Research based - spend certain amount of resources to 'unlock' humanities survival
  - Exploration based - find a habitable planet for humanity
  - Why not both? alternate endings :D
- Why is the end planet more habitable than others?
  - Need to come up with a good reason as to why the 'intermediate' planets aren't end game
- Planets can have different fuel costs for ship deployment
- Players can create space docks near planets to lower fuel costs?
  - Maybe this can speed up resource transfers too
- Fog of war

## GAME DESIGN NOTES

- Each unit of oxygen will sustain 100 people per day
- Each day will be set as an arbitrary amount of time irl (5 minutes or something)
