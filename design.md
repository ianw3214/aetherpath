# Aetherpath

Earth is on the brink of collapse; In order to survive, humanity must find a new home. Command starships and gather resources to save humanity!

## Overview

**Aetherpath** is a strategy game where the player commands fleets of starships to explore the the vast and unending space. The goal of the game is to find an inhabitable planet for all humans to migrate to, and successfully move enough humans to the target planet so that humanity can continue to prosper. In order to reach the goal, the player will have to utilize their ships efficiently to gather resources from space.

This game takes massive inspiration from _Faster than Light_ in many ways; One of the biggest ways is that beating the game should be a challenge for the player. Although there is no combat in the game, the managing of resources is hard enough to lose the game many times. There aren't too many RNG elements, so the player should be able to find flaws in their gameplay and improve after each loss.

## Mechanics

### Resources

There will be many resources the player has to manage, and each will have different uses in the game.

- *Population:* The main resource that the player needs to manage to win the game
- *Oxygen:* Required for population to live
- *Fuel:*  Required for spaceships to move
- *Metal:* Used to build more ships

If scope allows, there are some other resource ideas that might enhance gameplay.

- *Food:* Used to help increase human population somehow
- *Rare metal:* Differentiate between metal for building different kinds of ships

### Asteroids

Asteroids are resource nodes that float around in space. Their resources can be collected by ships, but the amount of resources they have can not be replenished. The size of these nodes will diminish as ships collect their resources, until they disappear into nothing.

### Planets

Like asteroids, planets also contain resources. However, they will not diminish in size as their resources get mined. Instead, the player can choose to colonize the planets, transferring any kind of resources from ships to the planet. The planet can then act as an intermediate base for the player to store resources and build ships. Each planet will have a maximum capacity of resources, and potentially more different traits to add variety if scope allows.

### Ships

Ships are used to transport and gather resources. There are many different types of ships that the player can control, from mining ships to scouts to heavy storage ships. Ships can be created on planets, and they all cost different amounts of resources to create. Their stats may also differ, between storage capacity, movement speed, mining speed, transfer speed, etc... More traits can potentially be added if scope allows.

### Character System

There are characters that the player can put in charge of certain tasks, and the player can develop different relationships with these characters. These players have different traits that can provide different boosts depending on their role. The player can assign them to be ship captains or planet governors, and they will level up with each action done on the entity they are assigned to.

The characters can either be randomly spawned or spawned based on a timer. They can also be spawned on either random planets or always on earth. If scope allows, players could also obtain certain characters depending on certain situations (spawned a certain character, found a certain planet, etc..)

## Map Generation

The map is populated with asteroids and planets, including one earth as the players starting base and one (or more) *target* planets, which is the end goal of the game. The resource nodes are populated with semi-random amounts of resources, but ensured to be distributed somewhat evenly so that the player always has a chance to win.
